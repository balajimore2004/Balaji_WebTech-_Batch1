        <p>
          Hello! I'm Balaji More, a passionate Computer Engineering student at
          MIT Academy of Engineering. I have a strong interest in coding,
          graphic design, and technology. I enjoy learning new skills and
          applying them to real-world projects. My goal is to make a positive
          impact in the tech industry through innovative solutions and creative
          designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am a dedicated learner who
          thrives in collaborative environments. I am always looking for
          opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge in the field of
          computer engineering.
